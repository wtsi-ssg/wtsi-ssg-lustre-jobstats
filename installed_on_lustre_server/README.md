# Lustre job stats exporter


This directory holds two sample web apps that export job stats
information from a lustre file system via an api endpoint

```
curl -s  http://lus23-oss1-mgmt.internal.sanger.ac.uk:8081  | jq .
{
  "lus23-OST0001": [
    {
      "write_bytes": {
        "max": 16777216,
        "sum": 1275960319678,
        "samples": 413177,
        "unit": "bytes",
        "min": 4
      },
      "job_id": "SA1TwDkwOzA7,team135",
      "setattr": {
        "samples": 7,
        "unit": "reqs"
      },
â€¦.
      "read_bytes": {
        "max": 16777216,
        "sum": 51588627873792,
        "samples": 22190157,
        "unit": "bytes",
        "min": 4096
      },
      "snapshot_time": 1667913397
    }
  ]
}
```

The imported python libraries are installed by default on an
exascaler system. We have included a sample systemd service
file `lustre-stats-web.service` which can be used to ensure that
the web service is started on boot.

The two versions of the code show a generic stats server and
one where the data is enriched from the decoded job name.
